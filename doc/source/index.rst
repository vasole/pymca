PyMca |version|
===============

PyMca is a collection of Python tools to assist on common data analysis problems.
When first released (in 2004), its main motivation was X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) Analysis,
field for which is among the most complete solutions available.

Synchotron radiation XRF is closely associated to microscopy. To properly achieve its objectives,
PyMca had to incorporate more than just 1D visualization and XRF spectrum modelling.
PyMca has evolved into a set of tools to provide close-to-the-source data visualization
and diagnostic capabilities.

The proper way to cite PyMca is:

The current version features:

- State-of-the-art X-Ray Fluorescence Analysis (Quantification, Mapping, ...)
- Support of multiple data formats 
- 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D imaging capabilities
- Extendible application via plugins.
- Large dataset imaging (XRF, Powder diffraction, XAS, FT-IR, Raman, ...)
- Multivariate analysis.
- Common data reduction operation (normalization, fitting, ...)
