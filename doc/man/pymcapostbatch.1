.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Start the graphical user interface of the PyMca X-Ray 
Fluorescence Toolkit image correlation tool.

This tool is automatically launched by the PyMca X-ray fluorescence 
toolkit after a batch analysis.

It allows one to superpose up to three images in RED, GREEN and BLUE in 
order to investigate correlations among them. All the images have to 
be of the same dimension.

The program builds a table with all the input images but only three 
of them can be superposed at the same time.

This program also offers the possibility to perform mathematical operations 
among the images and simple multivariate analysis.
